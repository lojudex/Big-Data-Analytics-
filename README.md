This report discusses the occupational status in Italy from 2005 to 2020. The report focuses on the employment rate and unemployment rate by
gender and in each region, with a focus on Sicily. From this general analysis we move on to a more specific one dealing with Neets, that is, young
people not working and not studying, and youth employment. The approach used to calculate the various employment and unemployment rates is
based on the total population aged 15 and over. Some factors such as education and some economic indicators such as GDP, GDP per capita, and
domestic labor income are related to the two rates mentioned.
As for occupational status, there are it different categories such as the labor force which is formed by the unemployed and the employed, and finally,
the inactive formed by those who are not looking for and not available for work and those who are part of the gray area of inactivity.
